<h1>My Go Journeys</h1>

<p>
    I've decided to keep a note or blog documenting my weekend explorations into different technologies. 
    This space will serve as a personal log of how I learn something new, tackle challenges, 
    and strive to improve my skills. By sharing my progress, I hope to reflect better on my 
    learning journey and maybe even help others along the way.

            Getting Started with Go: Building a RESTful API Server with PostgreSQL Database Integration - A Beginner's Journey
        </a>
        <blockquote>
            In this journey, I built a RESTful API server from scratch using Go, integrated it with a PostgreSQL database, 
            and implemented routing with <code>ServeMux</code>. I explored core Go concepts like handlers, package 
            management, and database connectivity—progressing from a beginner to building a working backend in just a few hours.

        <blockquote>
            In this follow-up, I modularized the project by separating request and DB logic into packages. 
            I replaced raw SQL with GORM for easier database handling and implemented GET/POST methods for user data. 
            I also introduced an adapter-like pattern for request models and began laying the groundwork for 
            Test-Driven Development (TDD) as I scale the backend.
